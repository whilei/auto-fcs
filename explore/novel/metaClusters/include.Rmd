Current Methods:

1. Run phenograph on each individual sample
2. For each sample's phenograph cluster, compute two types of centroids
  1. compute median compensated/transformed expression across all markers used
  2. compute median of the normalized (mean 0, SD 1) compensated/transformed expression across all markers use
3. Combine individual sample's centroids into a single matrix
4. Run phenograph on the combined matrix (currently using non-normalized input)
5. Run tsne on the combined matrix (currently using non-normalized input)
6. Plot results, coloring by marker expression and
