### Current Methods

1. Run phenograph on each individual sample, starting with cytotoxic T cells
2. For each sample's phenograph cluster compute:
  1.  median compensated/transformed expression across all markers used (calling this "RAW")
  2.  median of the normalized (mean 0, SD 1) compensated/transformed expression across all markers use
  3. Frequency of known cytotoxic subsets in the cluster
  4  Proportion of events in the phenograph cluster out of all events in each known cytotoxic subset
3. Combine individual sample's centroids into a single matrix
4. Run phenograph on the combined matrix (currently using "RAW")
5. Run tsne on the combined matrix (currently using "RAW")
6. Plot results, coloring by things
